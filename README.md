# 🧭 ClarityOps: Support Case Maturity Framework  
### Designing a structure for clarity, validation, and continuous growth  

---

## 🪄 Overview  
**ClarityOps** is an early-stage framework and prototype designed to help support teams improve case quality, consistency, and engineer maturity.  

Rather than a live scoring system, this phase focuses on **defining the model**, **standardizing deliverables**, and **building tools for onboarding and coaching**. 

It’s built to evolve into a measurable dashboard, but its foundation is a clear, teachable framework for how engineers learn, validate, and communicate in complex customer environments.  

---

## ❗ Problem  
Support engineers often jump into incident details before confirming they fully understand the problem or its customer impact. This leads to rework, inconsistent validation, and slower trust building.  

ClarityOps defines a structured path to help engineers stay focused, validate effectively, and communicate clearly. 

---

## 💡 Objectives  
- Define a **multi-phase troubleshooting framework**: that breaks the support process into clear, teachable stages.  
- Create a **case deliverables checklist** to clarify what "good" looks like for each phase.  
- Develop **maturity milestones** to help engineers self-assess and guide mentorship.  
- Build **templates and documentation** (in Markdown or Notion) that can evolve into automation later.  
- Design a **future dashboard mock-up** showing what observability of process might look like.  

---

## 🧰 Deliverables  
- Framework document (Markdown / PDF)  
- Case Deliverables Checklist  
- Engineer Maturity Milestone Map  
- Sample Runbook and Validation Template  
- Mock Dashboard
- README with reflection on next-phase automation ideas
