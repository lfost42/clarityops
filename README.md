# 🧭 ClarityOps: Support Case Maturity Framework  
### Designing a structure for clarity, validation, and continuous growth  

![logo](./logo.png)

---

## 🪄 Overview  
**ClarityOps** is an early-stage framework and prototype designed to help support teams improve case quality, consistency, and engineer maturity.  

This phase focuses on **defining the model**, **standardizing deliverables**, and **building tools for onboarding and coaching**. 

It’s built to evolve into a measurable dashboard, but its foundation is a clear, teachable framework for how engineers learn, validate, and communicate in complex customer environments.  

---

## ❗ Problem  

Onboarding for Support Engineers is can be an esoteric process, where technical and customer-facing training are not conducted in tandem. Deliverables beyond KPIs or CSATs can be vague or inconsistently defined, leaving new engineers uncertain about what success looks like. 

ClarityOps establishes a structured path that helps engineers stay focused, validate effectively, and communicate with confidence. It also introduces a maturity map that allows engineers to pursue professional growth intentionally, not merely as a byproduct of tenure or repetition. 

---

## 💡 Objectives  
- Define a **multi-phase troubleshooting framework**: that breaks the support process into clear, teachable stages.  
- Create a **case deliverables checklist** to clarify what "good" looks like for each phase.  
- Develop **maturity milestones** to help engineers self-assess and guide mentorship.  
- Build **templates and documentation** (in Markdown or Notion) that can evolve into automation later.  
- Design a **future dashboard mock-up** showing what observability of process might look like.  

---

## 🧰 Deliverables  
- Framework document (Markdown / PDF)  
- Case Deliverables Checklist  
- Engineer Maturity Milestone Map  
- Sample Runbook and Validation Template  
- Mock Dashboard
- README with reflection on next-phase automation ideas

## 🗂️ Project Structure

ClarityOps is organized into modular milestone folders that capture the framework’s evolution, from concept to documentation and prototype design.
