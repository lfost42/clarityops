# 🧭 Support Case Framework (Support Principles)

A concise guide for structured case handling and communication practices that emphasize **trust, clarity, and validation**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The **Support Case Framework** defines a repeatable approach to troubleshooting that strengthens customer confidence and improves team consistency.  
It promotes understanding before action, validation before communication, and reflection after resolution. It aims to turn support cases into opportunities for learning and long-term quality improvement.

## 🧩 Framework Overview

### 1️⃣ CONNECT — Clarify the Experience and Impact
**Goal:** Understand *who or what is affected* and *why it matters now.*

**Practices**
- Gauge urgency through active listening and playback.  
- Ask:
  - "Who or what is affected?"  
  - "What process or milestone does this block?"  
  - "What is the customer’s definition of done/success?"  
- Prefer live conversation when possible to confirm context and tone.  

**Outcome**
> A clear, customer-validated understanding of the issue and its impact.

### 2️⃣ LEARN — Document Steps to Reproduce and Collect Evidence
**Goal:** Make the issue **reproducible, testable, and clearly defined.**

**Practices**
- Ensure the **Steps to Reproduce (STR)** are complete, clear, and reproducible internally.  
- Reproduce the issue in a **demo org** whenever possible.  
- Define **Expected vs. Actual** outcomes.  
- Review customer-provided evidence for accuracy and relevance.  

**Outcome**
> A complete and verified problem statement, supported by reproducible data.

---

### 3️⃣ ANALYZE — Inspect and Research Potential Causes
**Goal:** Generate and prioritize **theories of probable cause**.

**Practices**
- Inspect **Splunk logs** for timing, performance, and error correlations.  
- Research similar or related issues in trusted systems such as **OrgCS**, **Org62**, and **GUS**.  
- Explore **Confluence** and other vetted third-party resources for related symptoms or patterns.  
- **Swarm in team chat** when next steps are unclear to gain perspective and accelerate troubleshooting.  

**Outcome**
> A short list of plausible causes, with supporting evidence and next investigative steps.

---

### 4️⃣ EVALUATE — Test and Confirm Possible Solutions
**Goal:** Validate the root cause and confirm viable paths to resolution.

**Practices**
- Test each plausible cause systematically.  
- Validate findings with **official documentation** or by testing in a **demo or customer org**.  
- Back up all **AI-generated suggestions** with official documentation and internal validation.  
- **Swarm or escalate** when a clear resolution path is not defined.

**Outcome**
> A validated, documented solution path supported by official evidence.

---

### 5️⃣ ACT — Present Validated Options and Next Steps
**Goal:** Communicate clearly and confidently with the customer.

**Practices**
- Present validated next steps with **official knowledge article links** where possible.  
- Communicate with **transparency, ownership, and empathy.**  
- When next steps remain uncertain, continue swarming and escalate per **safe harbor guidelines.**

**Outcome**
> The customer understands current progress, options, and ownership of next actions.

---

### 6️⃣ REFLECT — Reinforce Learning and Accountability
**Goal:** Convert each case into a learning opportunity for the team and the individual engineer.

**Practices**
- Document **lessons learned** and update knowledge resources accordingly.  
- Identify opportunities to improve process speed, clarity, and customer experience.  
- Share retrospectives during **office hours or team reviews** to reinforce collective learning.  

**Outcome**
> Improved process quality, shared insights, and growing team maturity.
