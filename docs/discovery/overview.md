# 🧭 Discovery Phase Overview

## 🎯 Purpose

The **Discovery Phase** establishes the foundation for the ClarityOps framework, a structured approach to troubleshooting and support case management designed to improve consistency, clarity, and engineer maturity across technical teams.

This phase focuses on defining the core principles, workflow stages, and success criteria that will shape how engineers approach problem-solving, validation, and communication.  

Discovery centers on **conceptual design**, the principles, structure, and artifacts that make reliability teachable.

## 🪄 The What

**ClarityOps** is a support enablement framework that:
- Turns troubleshooting into a **repeatable, teachable process**.  
- Encourages engineers to **confirm understanding, validate hypotheses,** and **communicate clearly**.  
- Helps teams move from reactive incident handling to **structured, proactive reliability practices**.  
- Provides a roadmap for **engineer maturity**, helping individuals take ownership of their growth.  

The goal: to make **clarity, validation, and consistency measurable** in technical support environments.

## 📦 Objectives

### Milestone 1 – Discovery (Current)
- Define a **multi-phase troubleshooting framework** that breaks the support process into clear, teachable stages; outline the purpose, expected behaviors, and handoffs at each phase to promote consistency and clarity.  
- Capture early feedback from peers and leadership to validate clarity, usability, and completeness.  
- Identify the artifacts and templates required for the next phase.

### Milestone 2 – Templates & Checklists (Next)
- Build **reusable templates** for playback, STR, validation, and cadence updates based on the Discovery framework.  
- Create the **maturity milestone map** for self-assessment and coaching.  
- Pilot the framework with new engineers and gather structured feedback.  
- Begin drafting **lightweight documentation** that can evolve into enablement or automation later.

### Milestone 3 – Visualization & Documentation (Future)
- Design a **dashboard mock-up** showing potential process observability.  
- Compile retrospectives, framework refinements, and presentation materials for enablement rollout.

## 🧱 Scope

**In Scope**
- Drafting the conceptual framework and defining behaviors for each troubleshooting phase.  
- Outlining tangible artifacts: checklists, templates, and a maturity model.  
- Capturing lessons learned and early team feedback for iteration.  

**Out of Scope**
- Implementation of scoring, analytics, or dashboards (planned for later milestones).  
- Automation or integration with existing support tooling.

## 🔍 Guiding Principles

1. **Validate Before You Share** – Engineers confirm accuracy and alignment with official sources before communicating solutions.  
2. **Clarity Over Speed** – The fastest path to resolution starts with a clear understanding of the problem and impact.  
3. **Communicate With Cadence** – Maintain transparent updates and clear ownership throughout the lifecycle of every case.  
4. **Learn in the Open** – Reflect on each engagement; make process improvements visible to the team.  
5. **Own Your Maturity** – Engineers can use the maturity model as a self-assessment and coaching tool.

## 🧠 Expected Outcomes

By the end of this phase:
- A **multi-phase troubleshooting framework** will serve as a guide to the development of deliverables and maturity map.  
- A **case quality checklist** will help standardize what "done" looks like.  
- A **maturity map** will define progression from foundational troubleshooting to leadership behaviors.  
- Foundational documentation will be ready for team pilot and review.

---

## 🗓️ Next Phase

Move into **Templates & Checklists**, where the conceptual framework becomes operational:  
- Turn framework phases into actionable templates (case checklists, validation worksheets, communication snippets).  
- Pilot with new engineers to validate usability and identify friction points.  
- Gather feedback to refine clarity and practicality.
