# 📝 Discovery Notes & Reflection

## 🧭 Overview
The Discovery phase focused on defining the **Support Case Framework**, a structured approach to case handling that emphasizes trust, clarity, and validation.  

The framework was drafted to **further contextualize and itemize the principles of case management** into **definitive deliverables** for each case and for an engineer’s maturity journey.  
By turning abstract expectations into clear, observable actions, the framework helps both new and experienced engineers approach cases with confidence, accountability, and a shared standard of quality.

This document summarizes lessons learned, design adjustments, and open questions as the project transitions into the next milestone.

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Discovery before diagnosis is critical.**  
  Many case escalations stem from unclear impact or incomplete reproduction steps. Adding structured playback (“Who or what is affected?”) drastically improved early understanding.  

- **Validation must be explicit.**  
  Engineers often trust documentation or AI-suggested fixes without internal testing. The "Validate Before You Share" principle addresses this by making validation a *required* step before communication.  

- **Communication is as important as resolution.**  
  Customers value cadence, empathy, and transparency as much as speed. The framework treats **communication as a deliverable**.  

- **Reflection reinforces maturity.**  
  Engineers who document what they’ve learned and share retros help the team evolve faster. Reflection closes the loop between case work and professional growth.

## 🧱 Design Adjustments

| Area | Original Assumption | Adjustment |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| Framework Phases | Reflection was initially optional. | Added **Reflect** as a dedicated, equal-weight phase. |
| AI / Agentforce Guidance | Could assist with faster troubleshooting. | Must always be validated internally or with official documentation. |
| Escalation Timing | Escalations happened inconsistently. | Added clear **swarm/escalation triggers** when a case stalls or lacks direction. |
| Evidence Capture | Logs and screenshots were inconsistently linked. | Defined **case deliverables** per phase for repeatable standards. |
| Learning Artifacts | Case notes were siloed. | Introduced **office hour retros** to surface shared lessons. |

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Lack of existing structure. | Without a shared framework, engineers default to ad-hoc troubleshooting, leading to inconsistent communication and uneven quality. | Establish clear, lightweight phases (Connect, Validate, Cadence) to provide a common anchor even in fast-moving situations. |
| Inconsistent adoption across engineers. | Reduced clarity and uneven customer experience. | Reinforce through onboarding, templates, and peer QA reviews. |
| Over-reliance on AI-generated suggestions. | Risk of inaccurate or unverified steps being shared. | Require official documentation or internal validation before customer communication. |

## ❓ Open Questions (for Next Milestone)

1. What is the **minimum viable template** for STR and validation that’s fast yet complete?  
2. Which **sources** are considered "official" per product or platform area?  
3. How can we make **cadence expectations** explicit (e.g., default every 2 business days)?  
4. What’s the best lightweight format for **case retros** that encourages participation?  
5. How might **maturity milestones** be self-assessed without introducing scoring overhead?

## 🧩 Early Wins

- The **six-phase model** improved clarity in case reviews and internal swarming.  
- **Playback and impact framing** shortened discovery time in multiple pilot cases.  
- The first draft of the **case deliverables checklist** helped align peer expectations.  
- Leadership feedback confirmed value in defining **maturity stages** to support coaching and self-assessment.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Transition to **Milestone 2 – Templates & Checklists**, focusing on:
- Translating each framework phase into **reusable templates** (playback prompt, STR checklist, validation worksheet, cadence update).  
- Drafting the **maturity milestone map** for self-guided growth and peer coaching.  
- Establishing a **feedback loop** between framework use, retrospectives, and iteration.
