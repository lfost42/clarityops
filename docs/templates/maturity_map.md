- [ ] Leverages **AI responsibly** for insight generation rather than decision-making.  
- [ ] Validates **AI-generated hypotheses** using official knowledge documents and human review.  
- [ ] Documents evidence trail clearly (what was tested, observed, and confirmed) to support post-case learning.  
- [ ] Swarms early when analysis reveals ambiguity or potential cross-cloud dependencies.

- [ ] Communicates findings with accuracy, empathy, and transparency.  
- [ ] Summarizes swarm status and progress when the case is otherwise stalled.  
- [ ] Adds case comment to clarify why cases are stalled if no pending action is apparent.  
- [ ] Adds internal note when case is left in Working status at EOS.
