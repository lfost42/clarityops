# ‚úÖ Case Checklist

A practical checklist for ensuring consistent, clear, and validated case handling ‚Äî aligned to the **ClarityOps Support Case Framework**.  
This guide defines the **deliverables for each case** and links to the long-term [Maturity Map](./maturity_map.md) for professional growth tracking.

---

## üß≠ Discovery & Understanding
- [ ] A **screenshare** was offered when appropriate (e.g., high-severity cases or when details remain unclear).  
- [ ] **Scope** has been clarified and documented.  
- [ ] **Urgency** has been clarified and documented.  
- [ ] Discovery questions were asked to gather complete context.  
- [ ] Follow-up questions were used to clarify the problem and understand the issue.  
- [ ] The correct **Product & Topic** are identified.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Validation
- [ ] **Steps to Reproduce (STR)** are documented accurately.  
- [ ] STR has been **reproduced and validated internally**.  
- [ ] **Supporting documentation** (logs, screenshots, configs) has been attached.  
- [ ] Gaps in understanding or reproducibility have been identified and addressed.  
- [ ] Proposed solutions have been **validated internally** with supporting evidence attached.  

---

## üí¨ Communication & Cadence
- [ ] **Next steps and timelines** are clearly defined and documented within the last 2 working days (or agreed cadence).  
- [ ] The **top case comment** is no older than 2 working days and includes either a public update or an internal note with next steps.  
- [ ] **Swarming and GUS progress** are documented when relevant.  
- [ ] Cases are placed in **NMI or SP** before going OOO for longer than a day.  

---

## üöÄ Execution & Escalation
- [ ] Troubleshooting, escalation, and validation steps are fully documented.  
- [ ] All key decisions, reproductions, and solution validations are recorded in the case notes.  
- [ ] **Escalation cadence and timelines** are followed when a path to resolution is unclear:  
  - All Cases: Swarm if next steps not identified within **2 working days**.  
  - Specialty/Dev Cases: Swarm **<5 days**, Structured Investigation **<7 days**.  
  - GU/Sub-scale Cases: Swarm **<2 days**, Structured Investigation **<5 days**.
