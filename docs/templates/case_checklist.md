## 🧭 Discovery & Understanding  
**Focus:** Establish shared context and comprehension: confirming scope, urgency, and clarity before investigation begins.  

- [ ] A **screenshare** was offered when appropriate (e.g., Sev1/2s, hot Sev2s, or cases that remain unclear after initial interactions).  
- [ ] **Scope** has been clarified and documented.  
- [ ] **Urgency** has been clarified and documented.  
- [ ] Discovery questions were asked to gather complete context.  
- [ ] Follow-up questions were used to clarify the problem and understand the issue.  
- [ ] Details of **call sessions** are documented in a case comment.  
- [ ] The correct **Product & Topic** is identified.

## ⚙️ Technical Validation  
**Focus:** Confirm reproducibility and quality of evidence: ensuring findings are verifiable and complete before analysis.  

- [ ] **Steps to Reproduce (STR)** are documented accurately.  
- [ ] Steps to Reproduce has been validated internally**.  
- [ ] **Supporting documentation** has been attached to the case.  
- [ ] Gaps in understanding or reproducibility have been identified and addressed before proceeding.  
- [ ] If possible, issue has been reproduced in isolated **sandbox environments** for testing and isolating potential root causes.  
- [ ] Evidence from the customer has been reviewed for accuracy and completeness.

## 🔍 Analysis  
**Focus:** Investigate, correlate, and validate: identifying root causes through research, logs, and expert collaboration.  

- [ ] Relevant logs (e.g., **Splunk**, debug logs, console, browser, system logs) have been analyzed for errors, trends, or performance indicators.  
- [ ] Prior related or similar cases and investigaitons have been reviewed for possible patterns or precedents.  
- [ ] Official documentation, internal articles, and trusted external sources have been searched and referenced.  
- [ ] When leveraging **AI**, all troubleshooting steps are performed by the engineer.  
- [ ] **AI-generated solutions** are validated with appropriate public-facing, official knowledge articles.  
- [ ] Initiated a collaborative review with Subject Matter Experts** when next steps are unclear.

## 💬 Communication & Cadence  
**Focus:** Maintain transparency and consistency: ensuring customers and internal stakeholders are informed and aligned.  

- [ ] **Next steps and timelines** are clearly defined and documented within the last 2 working days (or agreed cadence).  
- [ ] The **top case comment** is no older than 2 working days and includes either a public update or internal comment that identifies next steps.  
- [ ] **Collaborative review and Investigation progress** is documented when necessary.  
- [ ] Cases are placed in **Needs More Information or Solution Provided** prior to going out of office for longer than a day.

## 🚀 Execution & Escalation  
**Focus:** Drive resolution and accountability: documenting decisions, validations, and ensuring timely collaboration.  

- [ ] Documentation of troubleshooting, escalation, and validation steps is complete and accurate.  
- [ ] All key decisions, reproductions, and solution validations are recorded in the case notes.  
- [ ] **Escalation cadence and timelines** are followed when a path to resolution is not clearly defined:  
  - Initiated a collaborative review with appropraite teams if next steps have not been identified within **2 working days**.  
  - Structured Investigation if next steps have not been identified within **5 working days**.
